# Line and Bar Grades

You are going to assume the role of a teacher and create bar and line charts that visualize the grades of your students over the course of a semester.

## Instructions

* Create bar graphs that visualize the grades of all students in the class, one graph for every month.

* Create a line graph that shows the grades for all the student over the semester.

  * Use filtering in the line graph to allow you to drill down to a specific student's progress throughout the semester.

### Hint

* When duplicating bar graphs, it pays to get the formatting and look of the chart where you want it for the first graph (e.g. for January), and to then copy that chart and re-select the data for the subsequent copies (keeping the style and format, but just changing the data).
