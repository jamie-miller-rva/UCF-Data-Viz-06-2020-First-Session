# Outliers - Drawn and Quartiled

In this activity, you will be investigating data from a nutrition paper titled, "The total antioxidant content of more than 3100 foods, beverages, spices, herbs and supplements used worldwide" (Carlsen, M.H., Halvorsen, B.L., Holte, K. et al., 2010). Your task is to search through the antioxidant content of each product and determine if there are any potential outliers in the data set.

## Instructions

* Open up the activity workbook [07-Stu-OutliersDrawnQuartiled/Outliers_Activity_Unsolved.xlsx](Unsolved/Outliers_Activity_Unsolved.xlsx) and familiarize yourself with the raw data.

* Create a new worksheet and name it "Outlier Testing".

* In the "Outlier Testing" worksheet, create a summary statistics table of the `Antioxidant_content_in_mmol_100g` for the following statistics:

  * Mean

  * Median

  * Minimum value

  * Maximum value

  * First quartile

  * Third quartile

  * Interquartile Range

* Using the calculations from the table, determine the lower and upper boundaries of the `1.5*IQR` rule.

* Determine if there are any products whose `Antioxidant_content_in_mmol_100g` falls outside of the `1.5*IQR` boundaries. List those products and their antioxidant content on the worksheet.

* Create a box plot of the `Antioxidant_content_in_mmol_100g` for all products.

  * **Note**: Be sure to add a title, and label your y-axis.
