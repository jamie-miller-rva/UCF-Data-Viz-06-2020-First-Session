# Production Pivot

A small company sells electronics and electronic media has called upon you to create a table which visualizes the cost of their recent orders. Using the `VLOOKUP()` function, create a pivot table which serves this purpose.

## Instructions

1. Determine the "Product Price" of each row in the "Orders" sheet by using a `VLOOKUP()` that references each row's "Product ID"

* The "Product Price" of a row does not include shipping

2. Determine the "Shipping Price" of each row in the "Orders" sheet by using a `VLOOKUP()` that references each row's "Shipping Priority"

3. Select all of the data on the "Orders" sheet and create a new pivot table that calculates the sum of both "Product Price" and "Shipping Price" for each "Order Number" and "Product ID"
