# Write Netflix Data

Writing movie data to text file.

## Instructions

* Prompt the user for what video they are looking for.

* Search through the `netflix_ratings.csv` to find the user's video.

* Specify the file and path to write to the movie data.

* Open the file to hold the movie data.

* If the CSV contains the user's video then create a variable to add the title, the rating level, and current user rating inside parentheses.

* Write the movie data to the text file, and print the movie data to the console.

  * For example:
    ```txt
    Title: 30 Rock
    Rating Level: TV-14
    Rated: 66
    ```

* If the CSV does not contain the user's video then print out a message telling them that their video could not be found.
