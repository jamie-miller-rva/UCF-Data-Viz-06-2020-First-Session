# Netflix lookup

Find the info to some of Netflix's most popular videos

## Instructions

* Prompt the user for what video they are looking for.

* Search through the `netflix_ratings.csv` to find the user's video.

* If the CSV contains the user's video then print out the title, what it is rated and the current user ratings.

  * For example "Pup Star is rated G with a rating of 82"

* If the CSV does not contain the user's video then print out a message telling them that their video could not be found.

## Bonus

* You may have noticed that there is more than one listing for some videos.

  * Edit your code to have the title, the rating and user rating printed out only once.

  * Set a variable to `False` to check if we found the video.

  * In the `for loop` change the variable to confirm that the video is found.

  * Insert a `break` statement into the `for loop` to stop the loop when the **first** movie is found. See the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/simple_stmts.html#break) for additional info.

  * If the CSV does not contain the user's video then print out a message telling them that their video could not be found.
