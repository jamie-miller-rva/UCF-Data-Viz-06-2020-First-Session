## Good Movies

### Instructions

* Use Pandas to load and display the CSV provided in `Resources`.

* List all the columns in the data set.

* We're only interested in IMDb data, so create a new table that takes the Film and all the columns relating to IMDB.

* Filter out only the good movies—i.e., any film with an IMDb score greater than or equal to 7 and remove the norm ratings.

* Find less popular movies that you may not have heard about - i.e., anything with under 20K votes
