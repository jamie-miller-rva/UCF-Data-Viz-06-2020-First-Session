Change the data types of variables so the code will run without errors. 

## Instructions

Five variables have been created, but they’re declared as Object types, so the lines of code assigning values to them are causing errors!

For each variable, change the data type in its Dim statement so that the code will run without errors.


**Hint:** A list of VBA data types can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/data-type-summary)
